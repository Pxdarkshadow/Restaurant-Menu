# Papa's Pizzeria 🍕

A fun, game-inspired static website that showcases a simple digital menu for Papa's Pizzeria — built using only HTML with inline styles.

## 📋 Project Description

This is a lightweight HTML-only webpage that mimics the menu experience from the beloved *Papa's Pizzeria* game. It includes food images, descriptions, prices, and a basic order form — all without using external CSS or JavaScript.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎨 Cartoon-style header and food images  
- 🍕 Menu items: Pepperoni Pizza, Cheeseburger, and Miso Ramen  
- 💬 Item descriptions with price tags  
- 📝 Simple inline-styled layout using only HTML  
- 🛒 Basic order form to simulate item selection

## 📁 File Structure

```

/Restaurant\_Menu/
├── menu_file/
│   ├── restaurant_menu.html
│   ├── logo.jpg
│   ├── pizza.jpeg
│   ├── burger.jpg
│   └── ramen.jpg
└── README.md

```

## 🧠 How It Works

- All layout styling is handled via inline `style` attributes.  
- `<article>` tags group each menu item.  
- Images are resized using inline width/height.  
- A form allows users to select menu items and enter custom notes.

## 🚫 Limitations

- No interactivity (no JavaScript).  
- Basic styling only (inline CSS).  
- Not responsive for mobile devices.

## ✅ Ideal For

- Beginners learning HTML structure  
- Projects with HTML-only constraints  
- Game-inspired themed sites
